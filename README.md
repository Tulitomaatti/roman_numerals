# Roman numeral conversion tools

The functions r2n and n2r will convert roman numerals to integers and natural numbers to roman numerals, respectively. Error handling is nonexistent. 

## Works: 

* Conversion to/from with numbers in standard form from 1-4999
* Converting natural numbers to roman numerals, where parenthesis are used to replace overline in expressing large numbers in vinculum. 

## Doesn't work: 

* Decoding some rarer "nonstandard" forms. 

## TODO: 

* Decoding vinculus forms
* LaTeX / KaTeX / ? output for vinculus forms
* Nice errors handling / warnings. 
* Proper packaging
